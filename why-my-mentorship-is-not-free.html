            <p>
                Recently, one of my students requested a refund for his fee due to some reasons before the start of the batch, and I refunded his fee without any charges. Some other students have also requested refunds for various reasons, and I have refunded their fees as well. I am providing some proof of a student fee refund below.

            <p>
                There are some students who take 10 or 12 classes and then ask for a fee refund, or there are some students who don't take their classes seriously throughout the session, not doing any assignments or similar tasks, and then at the end, they come and say they want their fee back. I just want to tell them that this is not how it works. If it were, all students would do the same â€“ take classes and then ask for a refund at the end. If I were in your place, I wouldn't refund the fee either because you are receiving my time, experience, and the knowledge I've gained through my own mistakes over 4 years, as well as the knowledge I've acquired from my mentors and trainers for which I paid. And, of course, when you learn skills from me, you will eventually sell them to your clients, not work for them for free.

                Unfortunately, our Pakistani people often prefer an easy life and don't want to work hard. They want everything to come easily and for free, without any struggle. I don't have any enmity with you. I just want to create a friendly environment with my students.

                There is a significant difference between 'chooran' or 'manjan' sellers and professionals that you may not notice. I want to make it clear to everyone that not everyone will benefit from my mentorship; only those who put in the effort will. I'm not a snake oil seller because I have to answer to Allah.
            </p>

                After your registration, you can take classes peacefully for 3 days. If you wish to continue classes after that, you can, or you can opt not to and get your fee refunded within 3 days of your registration without any charges. If I do charge you, it's for my time, experience, and knowledge sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I never ever compared myself to anyone. I know that the knowledge everyone has is also available to me, and the knowledge I have is unique because I have learned from my extensive case study, full of numerous mistakes. You can take courses from expensive institutes, but if you still don't benefit, you can join me, and I will not disappoint you, Insha'Allah. Even the biggest trainers or YouTubers will never show you their projects (websites and apps), but my expertise are publicly available on my website.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are satisfied with my work experience, then join me; otherwise, don't, because a person's expertise is evident from their work. I am very supportive of my students, and perhaps some of my students take advantage of this. I not only teach my students skills but also how to sell those skills internationally. I make self-employed individuals, not job seekers. Some of my students are running their own digital marketing companies.
            </p>
            <p>So, the moral of the story is, if you want something in your life, then you have to pay for it. If someone wants something from you, they should also pay you. Wishing you all the best for your future. May you have great days ahead :) </p>
