            <p>
                You can make multiple sources of income after this mentorship program as much as you can let me tell you one of them. After this mentorship, if you don't want to do anything else, you can simply create your own websites and web applications, get AdSense approval for them, and sell them. If you want to create a simple and basic web application and sell it, its price is around $130-200, which is approximately 35 to 60 thousand Pakistani Rupees. And if you want to create a high-end web application and sell it, its price is approximately $400 or more, which is around 110 to 115 thousand Pakistani Rupees.

                After this mentorship, you will be capable of creating your own high-end web applications and selling them. You can make money by selling your services like website development, SEO and SMM services globally. I will guide you practically and step by step on how to find high-paying clients and how to sell your services or web applications to them, so don't worry.
