            <p>
                Noticing that these days, many influencers on social media show you 'golden mountains,' be cautious about these so-called influencers. They contact you on Instagram after showing you dreams of success and demand charges. Some people show you their Shopify dashboard, claiming they made thousands of dollars in sales with just a few dollars in ad spending. However, they never reveal the actual product costs, courier service charges, return rates, total ad spending, and much more. Before joining any platform, take a moment and look into the pros and cons to protect yourself from potential losses, both in terms of time and money.

            Similarly, some blogging influencers, not all, showcase substantial earnings in their AdSense accounts to attract followers to their Instagram profiles, with the intention of taking advantage of them. I fell for this trap when I was starting my blogging journey. I reached out to such an influencer, who then demanded a fee of 100,000 rupees for his services. I want to stress that there's no truth in this approach. These individuals may artificially boost their AdSense earnings through self-clicking and other means, but in the end, Google suspends or terminates their accounts, and they don't receive any payments. I experimented with a similar tactic once and ended up losing 854 dollars along with my AdSense account. I could have exploited people in the same way, but I choose to be honest because I'm accountable to Allah.

            So, the moral of the story is to be wary of these so-called social media influencers. Before joining any platform, make sure to consider both its advantages and disadvantages. Wishing you all the best ahead! <br>

          Thank you all! ðŸ¤—
